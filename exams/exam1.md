# Part 1

Create a pandas data frame that has the following schema, 

|  id   | age  | income |
| :---: | :--: | :----: |
|   1   |  25  | 30,000 |
|   2   |  26  | 32,000 |
|  ...  | ...  |  ...   |
| 9999  |  28  | 29,000 |
| 10000 |  21  | 41,000 |


The data contained in this data frame should satisfy the following constraints, 

* `id` should increment from 1 to 10,000. This does not need to be a column but can serve as the index of the data frame. 
* `age` should be randomly generated by sampling the "standard normal" distribution. Ages should approximately fall between 20 and 30 years old and have a mean of 25. (its fine if your numbers look slightly different. the goal here is to generate a normal distribution of ages that looks realistic)
* `income` should be generated using the same method as `age` but with income approximately falling between 25k and 45k with a mean of 35k. Again, it is fine if your numbers vary a bit as long as income is normally distributed. 


1. Display the minimum, maximum, and average (mean) values of `age` and `income`. 
2. Draw two histograms, using seaborn, in order to show that your data is normally distributed. Make sure that your axes are labeled and that you set a title for each chart.
3. Draw a scatter plot, using seaborn, that plots age vs. income. Set the aspect ratio to 1.5. Make sure that your axes are labeled and that you set a title.
4. Create a new column on your data frame, called `sector`, that contains one of four values: "jazz", "puck", "camp", and "flub". Hint: You should create a function called `assign_sector` and use `pandas.DataFrame.apply` to create the column.


> Assign "jazz" if age > 25 and income > 35k
>
> Assign "puck" if age < 25 and income > 35k
>
> Assign "camp" if age > 25 and income < 35k
>
> Assign "flub" to all remaining points


5. Draw another scatter plot similar to one you created in (3) except that "sector" is displayed using color.
6. Display the number of points in each `sector` where `income` is greater than 40k. 


# Part 2

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

1. Load [iris.csv](../assets/data/iris.csv) into a pandas data frame. Record the shape of the data frame. 
2. Display the first 10 rows of the dataset. Display the last 5 rows of the dataset.
3. Display the count of each value in the `species` column. 
4. Display the data types of the columns.

5. Draw a box plot, using seaborn, of iris petal width (cm) vs. species. Set the aspect ratio to 1.5. Make sure that your axes are labeled and that you set a title. What differences do you noticed in this plot? 

6. Draw a pairwise plot, using seaborn, of the four numerical columns and the one categorical column. Make sure to color by the categorical column. What do you notice about the dataset through analyzing this array of charts?

7. Draw a scatter plot that includes linear regressions, using seaborn, using any two features you find interesting. Color by species. Set the aspect ratio to 1.5. Make sure that your axes are labeled and that you set a title. What conclusions can you draw from this plot?


### Part 3

Continuing with the iris flower data set from Part 2, scale your features and use KMeans to cluster your data into 3 clusters. Use PCA to decompose your features into two dimensions. Draw a scatter plot for your two PCA dimensions and color the plot using the clustering results. Discuss the results from creating this chart.
