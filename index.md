## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, my goal is for you to be able to:

* Visualize data from a wide variety of sources,
* Analyze data using exploratory data analysis and clustering techniques
* Build and solve system dynamics problems,
* Construct a Monte-Carlo simulation model,
* Develop agent-based models for complex simulations,
* Approximate the roots of a continuous function by several techniques and understand the strengths and limitations of these techniques.

## W2 Requirements

This course is designated as a <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/Faculty_Handbook/2020-2021/Academic_Policies_and_Procedures/F_2_c__Writing_Across_the_Curriculum/">W2 Writing Intensive Course</a> and
includes these learning goals and assessment criteria. Writing will be assessed throughout
the semester through lab reports and the final paper, with multiple revision
opportunities and feedback provided regularly.

# Attendance

We will be meeting this semester through Microsoft Teams.
This course will be using all of our scheduled time slots (10:10 - 11:00am MWF) for synchronous meetings
throughout the semester. I expect you to be present and participating in our discussions
and small group work sessions, with video and audio turned on for at least part of
each class. There will be regular attendance polls and the chat feature for additional
forms of course participation. If you have difficulties meeting these expectations,
please contact me, the Office of Academic Success, the IT HelpDesk, and the Provost's Office
to discuss alternate accommodations.

# Coursework

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish.
Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family
obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments
will receive at most half credit.

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through semi-weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned on Monday with time allotted to work through the materials, and will typically be due **at Friday 11:59pm of that week**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

On these labs, you will work with partners on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

## <a name="projects">Project</a>: 300 points

| #  | Name |
|:--:|-----|
|1 | [Final Project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project.html)  |

You will have a final project in this course.
Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for this
project will be given when it is assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>: 240 points

There will be two take-home exams, both worth 120 points of
your final grade. They will consist of **individually** working through
problems directly related to the labs.

* [Exam 1]({{site.baseurl}}/exams/exam1.html): Sep 18-24, covering data analytics and visualization
* [Exam 2]({{site.baseurl}}/exams/exam2.html): Oct 23-29, covering modeling and simulation

There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as described above under Project.

## <a name="hwqz">Checkins and Formative Assessment</a>: 100 points

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to
make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. Each checkin
meeting will count for 15 points.
This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding.
These should be scheduled during the weeks shown
on the [course calendar](https://app.teamgantt.com/public/projects/calendar/2020-08-01?ids=2238941&projectIds=2238941&publicKeys=fItPsEP7nOQ4).

Also, there will be many opportunities to accumulate small amounts of points
throughout the semester by participating in classroom exercises and
reflecting on the material. These will total at least 40 points, most likely more.
