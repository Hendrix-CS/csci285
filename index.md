## <a name="labs">Labs</a>

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through labs. We will set aside time in class for working on labs together. The instructor will make time for lab Q/A every week to address common pain points. 

On these labs, you will work with partners on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a ***\*single copy\**** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>

There will be two exams administered throughout the semester in order to evaluate your competency with the course material. They will consist of **individually** working through problems directly related to the labs and lectures. We will reserve the class period before the exam for "Module Review". This is meant to be exam prep, Q/A, and cover any lingering subject matter in the module.

## <a name="project">Final Project</a>
A major component of this course is a "Final Project" which we will build up to over the second half of the semester with various incremental deadlines.

## <a name="checkins">Checkins</a>

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding. These should be scheduled, in advance, using the available time slots.These checkins are a component of your final grade.

<br/>

# <a name="policies">Policies<a/>

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attending class and being an active participant in the class community
is one of the [most important contributors to your learning at Hendrix](https://www.hendrix.edu/Catalog/2023-2024/Academic_Policies_and_Regulations/Policies_and_Appeals/D_6_e__Class_Attendance/).
Attendance is especially important in this class since you will often engage in group learning activities. Active participation is expected in order to achieve higher grade levels in the course. 

If you know that you will be absent, please email me so that we can find accomodations. If there is an emergency, please get in touch with me as soon as is possible once the emergency is resolved. I trust you to be honest with me about your reasons for the absence (I do not need details), and honest with yourself about if you truly need to be absent. **If you do not communicate with me about your absence, or if your reason for absence is not listed on the Hendrix Attendance Policy, it will likely be unexcused.**

## <a name="latework">Due Date Policy</a>

[*Adapted from Spencer Bagley and David Clark, via [Robert
Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/a-real-world-approach-to-deadlines/)*]

CSCI 285 uses a **real-world policy** on due dates---but this may not
mean what you think! In the *real* real world, due dates exist but
they are often not ironclad. Assignments have due dates to help you 
make progress in the course and solidify your knowledge before moving on 
to something new. Your life and schedule may not perfectly coincide 
with the due dates I have chosen. If you need more time to
get the job done well, you email whoever set the deadline to ask if
you can have more time. Studies have shown that deadline extension
requests---in moderation and when truly needed---often lead to
*better* employee evaluations (not to mention better work). [*See [Go
Ahead and Ask for More Time on that
Deadline](https://hbr.org/2021/12/go-ahead-and-ask-for-more-time-on-that-deadline)
by Ashley Williams*.]

**If you need an extension on a due date, email me and explain what
you need**, and it will probably be fine. It helps if you propose a
concrete new deadline (*e.g.* "I can get it done by 5pm on
Wednesday"). If you ask for lots of extensions, we'll work together
to find a way to help you keep up. Note, however, that late
submissions may not receive feedback as quickly as on-time
submissions.

If you have significant extenuating circumstances that cause you to
miss multiple deadlines, please [come to office
hours](markgoadrich.youcanbook.me) to discuss broader accommodations.  I'm
happy to be flexible, but it helps to know what you need so I can
figure out the best way to help.

{% include important.html content="You must be in communication with me anytime an assignment is late." %}

If you would like to improve an assignment after it has been graded and improve your grade, you may revise and resubmit the assignment until you do. This must be **within two weeks of receiving feedback**. If you need more than two weeks, *you must schedule a meeting with me to discuss your reasons for the delay*.

{% include important.html content="All work and revisions must be completed the day of the final exam period for this course at 5pm." %}

## <a name="scale">Specifications Grading</a>

Each assignment is assessed as **Complete**, **Partially Complete** or **Not Complete**. Criteria for the first two categories will be specified for each assignment. Final course grades are earned based on cumulative assignment outcomes.

    * **Complete** two **Exams**.
    * **Complete** six out of seven **Labs** with the other at least **Partially Complete**.
    * **Complete** the **Final Project**
    * Schedule and attend a minimum of three **Checkins** (office hour appointments)
    * Up to one unexcused absence.

* To earn a B in the course, a student will:
    * **Complete** one **Exam** and **Partially Complete** the remaining **Exam**.
    * **Complete** five out of seven **Labs** with the other two at least **Partially Complete**.
    * **Complete** the **Final Project**
    * Schedule and attend a minimum of two **Checkins** (office hour appointments)
    * Up to one unexcused absence.

* To earn a C in the course, a student will:
    * **Partially Complete** two of the **Exams**.
    * **Complete** four out of seven **Labs** with **Partially Complete** on at least two more.
    * **Partially Complete** the **Final Project**
    * Schedule and attend a minimum of one **Checkins** (office hour appointments)
    * Up to two unexcused absences.

* To earn a D in the course, a student will:
    * **Partially Complete** one of the **Exams**.
    * **Complete** three out of seven **Labs** with **Partially Complete** on at least two more.
    * **Partially Complete** the **Final Project**
