* Analyze & visualize data sets from a variety of sources.
* Learn several analysis techniques including clustering and regression.
* Model and solve system dynamics problems.
* Construct a Monte-Carlo simulation model.
* Develop agent-based models for complex simulations.
* Approximate the roots of continuous functions.
* Understand the strengths and limitations of numerical techniques.
* Write idiomatic python and use scientific python libraries.

### W2 Requirements

This course is designated as a <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/Faculty_Handbook/2020-2021/Academic_Policies_and_Procedures/F_2_c__Writing_Across_the_Curriculum/">W2 Writing Intensive Course</a> and includes these learning goals and assessment criteria. Writing will be assessed throughout the semester through lab reports and the final paper, with multiple revision
opportunities and feedback provided regularly.

<br>

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

We will be meeting this semester in MCREY 315. This course will be using all of our scheduled time slots (TR  2:45 PM-4:00 PM) starting on 8/23/2022 and ending on 12/15/2022. I expect you to be present and participating in our discussions and small group work sessions. If we are forced to meet remotely (e.g. weather, public health, etc.), then I expect video and audio turned on for at least part of each class. If you have difficulties meeting these expectations, please contact me, the Office of Academic Success, the IT HelpDesk, and the Provost’s Office to discuss alternate accommodations.

<br>

## <a name="checkins">Checkins</a>

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding. These should be scheduled, in advance, using the available time slots [found here](https://calendly.com/wilsojb/30min). These checkins are a component of your final grade.

<br>

## <a name="latework">Late Work Policy</a>

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish. Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments will receive at most partial credit.

In order to spend a late day, the instructor must be notified, by email, prior to the deadline.

<br>

## <a name="scale">Specifications Grading</a>

Each assignment is assessed as **Complete**, **Partially Complete** or **Not Complete**. Criteria for the first two categories will be specified for each assignment. Final course grades are earned based on cumulative assignment outcomes. **Late Work** is automatically given **Partially Complete** without any further consideration. See the **Late Work Policy** to understand this requirement.

* To earn an A in the course, a student will:
    * **Complete** two **Exams** and at least **Partially Complete** the remaining **Exam**.
    * **Complete** seven out of eight **Labs** with the other at least **Partially Complete**.
    * Maintain an 85% or higher on the **Final Project**
    * Schedule and attend a minimum of three **Checkins** (office hour appointments)
    * Up to one unexcused absence.

* To earn a B in the course, a student will:
    * **Complete** one **Exam** and **Partially Complete** the remaining **Exams**.
    * **Complete** six out of eight **Labs** with the other two at least **Partially Complete**.
    * Maintain an 75% or higher on the **Final Project**
    * Schedule and attend a minimum of two **Checkins** (office hour appointments)
    * Up to one unexcused absence.

* To earn a C in the course, a student will:
    * **Partially Complete** all three **Exams**.
    * **Complete** five out of eight **Labs** with **Partially Complete** on at least two more.
    * Maintain an 65% or higher on the **Final Project**
    * Schedule and attend a minimum of one **Checkins** (office hour appointments)
    * Up to two unexcused absences.

* To earn a D in the course, a student will:
    * **Partially Complete** two **Exams**.
    * **Complete** four out of eight **Labs** with **Partially Complete** on at least two more.
    * Maintain an 65% or higher on the **Final Project**
    * Up to three unexcused absences.


### Revising Labs

If a submitted **Lab** receives a **Partially Complete** assessment and the student seeks a **Complete** assessment:

- In most cases, detailed feedback will be provided with requirements necessary for a revision to be considered **Complete**. A deadline will also be established – typically a week after the assignment is returned.
- If the student has any questions or is uncertain what those requirements are, they should schedule an office hour appointment.
- If the student submits revisions which meet the requirements by the deadline, the revised **Lab** will receive a **Complete** assessment.

If a submitted **Lab** receives a **Not Complete** assessment, a similar list of requirements will be provided. In most cases, a **Not Complete** assessment can only be upgraded to **Partially Complete**, but the instructor reserves the right to allow students to achieve **Complete** on a case-by-case basis.

## <a name="labs">Labs</a>

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through labs. We will set aside time in class for working on labs together. The instructor will make time for lab Q/A every week to address common pain points and we'll generally spend half of our in class time working on labs together. 

Labs will be issued on the morning of a "lab day". **Attendance is required** on these days. Every lab (sans the final lab) is due before the next lab begins. This results in most labs being due one week after being discussed with a couple spread out over longer time windows. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

On these labs, you will work with partners on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a ***\*single copy\**** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

<br>

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>

There will be three exams administered throughout the semester in order to evaluate your competency with the course material. They will consist of **individually** working through problems directly related to the labs and lectures. There will be no "pop" quizzes. You will know when each exam is scheduled to occur.

These exams will be allotted three full class periods. We will also reserve the class period before the exam for "Module Review". This is meant to be exam prep, Q/A, and cover any lingering subject matter in the module. 

<br>

## <a name="project">Final Project</a>
A major component of this course is a "Final Project" which we will build up to over the second half of the semester with various incremental deadlines.
