## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

Upon completing this course, my goal is for you to be able to:

* Visualize data from a wide variety of sources,
* Analyze data using exploratory data analysis and clustering techniques
* Build and solve system dynamics problems,
* Construct a Monte-Carlo simulation model,
* Develop agent-based models for complex simulations,
* Approximate the roots of a continuous function by several techniques and understand the strengths and limitations of these techniques.

<br>

## W2 Requirements

This course is designated as a <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/Faculty_Handbook/2020-2021/Academic_Policies_and_Procedures/F_2_c__Writing_Across_the_Curriculum/">W2 Writing Intensive Course</a> and
includes these learning goals and assessment criteria. Writing will be assessed throughout
the semester through lab reports and the final paper, with multiple revision
opportunities and feedback provided regularly.

## Attendance

We will be meeting this semester in MCREY 315. This course will be using all of our scheduled time slots (TR  2:45 PM-4:00 PM) starting on 8/23/2022 and ending on 12/15/2022. I expect you to be present and participating in our discussions and small group work sessions. If we are forced to meet remotely (e.g. weather, public health, etc.), then I expect video and audio turned on for at least part of each class. If you have difficulties meeting these expectations, please contact me, the Office of Academic Success, the IT HelpDesk, and the Provostâ€™s Office to discuss alternate accommodations.

<br>

## Checkins

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding. These should be scheduled during the weeks shown on the course calendar.

<br>

## Late Work Policy

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish. Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments will receive at most partial credit.

In order to spend a late day, the instructor must be notified, by email, prior to the deadline.
