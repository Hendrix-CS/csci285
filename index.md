### W2 Requirements

This course is designated as a <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/Faculty_Handbook/2020-2021/Academic_Policies_and_Procedures/F_2_c__Writing_Across_the_Curriculum/">W2 Writing Intensive Course</a> and
includes these learning goals and assessment criteria. Writing will be assessed throughout
the semester through lab reports and the final paper, with multiple revision
opportunities and feedback provided regularly.

<br>

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

We will be meeting this semester in MCREY 315. This course will be using all of our scheduled time slots (TR  2:45 PM-4:00 PM) starting on 8/23/2022 and ending on 12/15/2022. I expect you to be present and participating in our discussions and small group work sessions. If we are forced to meet remotely (e.g. weather, public health, etc.), then I expect video and audio turned on for at least part of each class. If you have difficulties meeting these expectations, please contact me, the Office of Academic Success, the IT HelpDesk, and the Provostâ€™s Office to discuss alternate accommodations.

<br>

## <a name="checkins">Checkins</a>

Three times throughout the semester, you are expected to make an office hours appointment and check in with me about the course. This will be conversation and feedback about your current progress and understanding. These should be scheduled during the weeks shown on the course calendar.

<br>

## <a name="latework">Late Work Policy</a>

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester as they wish. Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days, late assignments will receive at most partial credit.

In order to spend a late day, the instructor must be notified, by email, prior to the deadline.

## <a name="labs">Labs</a>

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through labs. We will set aside time in class for working on labs together. The instructor will make time for lab Q/A every week to address common pain points and we'll generally spend half of our in class time working on labs together. 

Labs will be issued on the morning of a "lab day". **Attendance is required** on these days. Every lab (sans the final lab) is due before the next lab begins. This results in most labs being due one week after being discussed with a couple spread out over longer time windows. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

On these labs, you will work with partners on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a ***\*single copy\**** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, all students must use a late day.

<br>

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>

There will be three exams administered throughout the semester in order to evaluate your competency with the course material. They will consist of **individually** working through problems directly related to the labs and lectures. There will be no "pop" quizzes. You will know when each exam is scheduled to occur.

These exams will be allotted three full class periods to complete. We will also reserve the class period before the exam for "Module Review". This is meant to be exam prep, Q/A, and cover any lingering subject matter in the module.
