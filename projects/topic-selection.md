## Description

As mentioned on the [Final Project Page](project.md), a good inspiration for topics is the [COMAP Contests in Modeling](https://contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/previous-contests.php). The problems from previous years are posted for both the Mathematical and Interdisciplinary contests, and most of these would be suitable for investigation. You may choose another topic beyond these questions, but it must be as complex and interesting as those posed above.

When selecting a topic, you want to make sure it is sufficiently complex and interesting. In order to help with topic selection, I've put together some criteria for you to consider. 

### Data Quality Criteria

Your topic must involve analyzing data. This data can be either pulled from an external source, cleaned up and further processed, or it can be generated. As long as the data lends itself to non-trivial analysis and visualization, either approach is acceptable. 

Your data needs to have numerical and categorical features. Ideally, more than one numerical and more than one categorical feature. However, exceptions can be made at my discretion. Time-series datasets are also a rich source of information but this is not a requirement.

### Modeling Criteria

Your topic must lend itself to the computational modeling techniques discussed in the second half of the course. 

* System Dynamics ~ Finding solutions to systems of ordinary differential equations. 
* Monte Carlo ~ Finding solutions to probabilistic systems using repeated random sampling.
* Agent-based Modeling ~ Finding solutions to systems through actions and interactions of autonomous agents.

Consider the following in your research for a topic: Does my topic seem to exhibit underlying mathematical structure? In other words, could an equation (or set of equations, or probabilities, or an algorithm, etc.) be written to explain my topic? If you are unsure about your topic selection meeting this criteria, please involve me. 

{% include note.html content="While machine learning techniques (such as clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction) are considered "modeling", this is _most likely_ not sufficient for meeting the modeling critiera _by itself_. Of course, you can use the techniques we discussed in class (and you should!), but the modeling critieria should mainly be met through the most recent subject matter. Exceptions can be made, at my discretion, for a group that wants to go _way deeper_ into machine learning for their final project than we were able to cover in class." %}
