## What To Turn In

As you work on this lab, record all of your progress in a Jupyter notebook. Record your solutions and attempts in `Code` blocks, and annotate what you did with `MarkDown` blocks. Cite all the webpages you find and use in your search for your solution. You should turn in this notebook and all of the data you used. A good solution should read like a self-contained report.

* Add your name and your lab partner at the top of the notebook. 
* Turn in a zip file that contains your notebook and any data needed to run the notebook.
* []()
