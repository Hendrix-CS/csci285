## Overview

In this lab you will refresh your Python skills and become familiar
with installing Anaconda and Jupyter on your own machine.

## Materials

* [Puzzle Files](../assets/data/puzzle.zip)

## Description

    Let the missing be your order,
    Leaving out the one I drop.
    Bright has won while dim is zilching,
    Go around until you stop.
    Split the journey into thirds as keys
    For what had come before.
    Tragic end on island clifftop
    And in forty-four no more.

## What To Turn In

Write a program in Python that solves the riddle above, using the puzzle files provided.
Solving the puzzle by hand without evidence of coding will only be awarded minimal points.

As you work on this lab, record all of your progress in a Jupyter notebook, both
successes and failures. Record your solutions and
attempts in `Code` blocks, and annotate what you did with `MarkDown` blocks.
Cite all the webpages you find and use in your search for your solution.

## Grading

* 20 points for code which leads to the correct answer.
* 10 points for proper citations of references.
* 10 points for written explanations of your attempts.
